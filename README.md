Usage: `regex_jams REGEX` 

Recursively search for and play music in compliance with the given regular expression.

Deps: 
  - `find` (the regex depends on your `find` dialect)
  - `mplayer` (u can readily use something else like `cvlc` or `madplay`)
  - `sed`, but you could use `awk`, `perl`, `ruby`, `python` or whatever...
